<!-- ABOUT THE PROJECT -->
## About The Project


FIRST Mate is designed to both entertain and inspire and teaches students of any age the FIRST Robotics design process through a gamified computer program, which takes users through the process of building a pirate ship, FIRST-style!

Here's why:
* We want to facilitate the process of teaching the engineering process to students.
* Our team prioritizes an efficient design process when creating our robot and we want to make the information we use to do so accessible to all.
* It's important for students to learn about design process and documentation for more than just robotics; these skills carry over into any careers in computer science or engineering.

<!-- USAGE EXAMPLES -->
## Usage

This program is designed for use in the classroom and for students interested in learning more about engineering and design. For younger students, we recommend a guided approach to introduce young engineers to the process of design documentation, but students in middle or high school may prefer to explore the game on their own. 

For a full list of tutorials on using the program, please see the instructional videos on our team YouTube channel!

_For more examples, please refer to the [Documentation](https://example.com)_
