## About FIRSTMate

FIRSTMate is powered by FRC team 9181, the PlatyPirates! We are an all-girls team from Houston, Texas that is passionate about STEM education!

FIRSTMate is designed for use in the classroom as a zero-cost, interactive way to teach the engineering design process. By building their own pirate ships, students practice concepts like:
* Design documentation
* Modularity
* Iteration
* Testing

If you and/or your students are having trouble accessing our using FIRSTMate, please let us know! Report a bug using the links at the top of this page, or email us at team@platypirates.org.

FIRSTMate is built with Java and distributed via GitHub. 

## Getting Started
### Lesson Planning
Please visit our YouTube channel for helpful videos regarding FIRSTMate! Feel free to show these videos, which explain the parallels between FIRSTMate and FIRST Robotics, in lessons!

If your students are not able to use FIRSTMate individually, we recommend building a ship together as a class. If students create their ships individually, we recommend that the teacher assist all students in moving into each stage at the same time.
